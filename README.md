# My-Portfolio

## About me
As a new full-stack web developer and as an alumni of SMU coding bootcamp, I am  eager to learn more. I will continue to gain knowledge throughout my entire career, not only because I love to learn, but I believe that it is an essential skill in the ever-evolving world of modern technology.

## Description
- I created this portfolio to showcase the skills that I have learned throughout my time at SMU bootcamp, and the accomplishments that have resulted from collaborations. What these projects reflect is teamwork, perserverance, communication, and overall hardwork.
